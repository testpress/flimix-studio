/**
 * Registers a callback to be executed when the SDK becomes ready.
 * 
 * Purpose: Allows external code to wait for the SDK to finish initialization
 * before performing operations that depend on the SDK being fully loaded.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - If SDK is already ready: callback executes immediately
 * - If SDK is not ready: callback is queued and will execute when SDK becomes ready
 * 
 * This is useful for ensuring proper initialization order and preventing
 * race conditions where code tries to use the SDK before it's ready.
